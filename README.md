# Project_1
The Motive of the project is to understand peripherals of Nexys 4DDR (FPGA) Board and Integration of IP's in your own project.
The target is to design and implement hardware to receive audio samples, store, process, and send to audio out using NEXYS 4 DDR.
Methodology:
1. Use built-in microphone and ADC ports
2. Implement FIR Filter
3. Make use of IP core of XADC
4. Make use of either BRAM memory or DDR RAM memory for storage
5. Use modular design approach
6. Functional simulation for FIR Filter
7. Make 5 minute video presentation explaining project.
NOTE: The video will be uploaded to youtube after completation of project.
